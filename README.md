This project explores the properties and frequency of the Bora wind in Trieste based on hourly meteorological observations of the Trieste molo F.lli Bandiera observatory, provided by OSMER. The Bora is herein assumed to be any wind coming from the north (N), northeast (NE), or east (E) with a speed of at least 10 m/s (36 km/h).

- How often does the Bora blow in Trieste?
- Monthly patterns to observe seasonal behavior.
- Is it true, as people claim in Trieste, that the Bora blows for an odd number of days?
- Annual trends of the Bora (by month)
- Daily trends of the Bora (by hour).
- Historical trends of the Bora (over time).
- A specific measurement is available in the data set (temperature, pressure, etc.) and its association with the Bora.
